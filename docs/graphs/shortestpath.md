Given the starting vertex, can you find the shortest path to any of the vertices in a **weighted** graph

- Why weighted? Since for an unweighted graph we can find the shortest path via DFS/BFS.

**Edge Relaxation:** In cases, when there are multiple paths from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, if `d[u]+w(u,v) < d[v]` , we update `d[v]` to be `d[u]+w(u,v)`. This is equivalent to tightening the edge with minimum weight such that the edge with higher weights is relaxed.

| Algorithm      | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dijakstra      | Shortest path *from one* node *to all* nodes, *no negative edges* allowed |
| Bellman-Ford   | Shortest path *from one* node *to all* nodes, *negative edges* allowed |
| Floyd-Warshall | Shortest distance between *all pair* of vertices, **negative edges** allowed |




## Dijkstra Algorithm

Greedy approach, for graphs with **only non-negative edges** to determine the shortest path between source vertex to all other vertices. 

{: .note}

Dijkstra is implemented via prority queue. We might have the same node multiple times in the heapq, however, the entry with minimum distance will be visited earlier.

**Time Complexity:** `O(E + VlogV)` for Fibonacci heaps, and `O(V + ElogV)` for binary heaps. Generally, it is considered `O((V+E).log(V+E))`

**Space Complexity:** `O(V)`

```python
def dijakstra(g, src, n): # Graph g with vertex src and total n vertices
	dist, visited = [float("inf")]*n, [False]*n
	heap = heapq([[0, src]])
	dist[src] = 0
	while q:
		_, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
		if visited[u]: continue
		visited[u] = True
		for (v, w) in g[u]:
			if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
				dist[v]	= dist[u] + w
				heapq.hepapush(heap, [dist[v], v])
```



## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Uses DP-like technique, works for **graphs with negative edges**, to find the shortest path between source vertex to all other vertices.

- **Theorem 1:** In a *graph with no negative weight cycles* with `N` vertices, the shortest path between any two vertices has at most `N-1` edges

- **Theorem 2:** In a *graph with negative weight cycles*, there is no shortest path

{: .note}

If the weight keeps reducing after N-1 iterations, it means that the graph has negative weight cycles

- Optimization 1: Can use 1-D DP array to reduce space-complexity to `O(V)`

- Optimization 2: Can stop early, with in-place replacements if there is no change

**Time Complexity:** `O(E.V)`, **Space Complexity:** `O(V^2)`

```python
# Graph g with vertex src and total n vertices
def bellman_ford(g, src, n): 
	k = n-1 # gives the minimum distance considering only k edges
	dp = [float("inf")]*n for _ in range(k)]
	dp[0][0] = 0
	for i in range(k):
		for u, v, d in g: 
		# u: source vertex, v: dest vertex, d: distance
			dp[i][v] = min(dp[i][v], dp[i-1][u]+d)
```

### Shortest Path Faster Algorithm

In the Bellman-Ford algorithm, if there is an update for vertex `v`, mark it as *present in the queue* and add it to the queue. If such a vertex already exists, donâ€™t add it to the queue. This will improve the average time complexity but the worst case time-complexity will remain same.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

[[Explanation]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQeCuLYj-4&ab_channel=MichaelSambol)

```python
def floyd_warshall(N, weight): # N verties, and weight(u,v)
  dist = [[float("inf")]*N for _ in range(N)]
  for i in range(N): dist[i][i]=0
  for each edge (u,v): dist[u][v]=weight(u,v)
  for k in range(N): #Intermediate node
      for i in range(N):
          for j in range(N):
              if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                  dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
```

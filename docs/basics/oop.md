# Basic OOP Concepts

- **Abstract Data Type:** A logical description of how we view the data and operations without regard to how they will be implemented
- **Encapsulation:** Details of implementation are hidden from users' point of view
- **Classes:** Description of what data look like and what data can do. They are analogous to abstract data types
- **Objects:**  Instance of class
- **Inheritance:** A class is derived from another (parent) class, inheriting all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.
- **Singleton class:** Restrics the instantiation of a class for only once.

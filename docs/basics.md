- **Abstract Data Type:** A logical description of how we view the data and operations without regard to how they will be implemented

- **Classes:** Description of what data look like and what data can do. They are analogous to abstract data types
- **Objects:**  Instance of class

- Must have a recursive call to the function itself
- The algorithm must change its state and move towards the base case
